      <p>Mozilla Firefox (branded and simply known as Firefox) is a free and open source[18] web browser that is made by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. It works on common operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. With Firefox, browsing features can be added or removed and users can customize Firefox to fit their needs. This was done to make Firefox safe and simple to use.
         On most operating systems, Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to load web pages, which uses up-to-date web standards.[19] However, Firefox for iOS, which was released in late 2015, does not use Gecko due to Apple's restrictions which only allow third-party web browsers to use the WebKit-based layout engine that is built into iOS.
